# Problem 002 - Even Fibonacci Numbers

## Description

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

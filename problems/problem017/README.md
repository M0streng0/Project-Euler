# Problem 017 - Number Letter Counts

## Description

If the numbers to are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total.

If all the numbers from 1 to 1000(one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used?

**NOTE**: Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example,
(three hundred and forty-two) contains letters and (one hundred and fifteen) contains letters. The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in compliance with British usage.
